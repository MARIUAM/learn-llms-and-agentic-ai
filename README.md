Welcome to **Learn LLMs and Agentic AI**!  
This repository is a hands-on, practical guide to understanding and building with Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.  
Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, you’ll find step-by-step notebooks and scripts for exploring everything from basic prompts to agentic workflows and model fine-tuning.
