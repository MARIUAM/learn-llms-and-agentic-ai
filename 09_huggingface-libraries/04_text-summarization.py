It allows users to perform a wide range of tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering, among others.
It's an extremely popular library that's widely used by the open-source data science community.
It lowers the barrier to entry into the field by providing Data Scientists with a productive, convenient way to work with transformer models.
